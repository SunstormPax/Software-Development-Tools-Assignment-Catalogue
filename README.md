Catalogue app

The following kotlin app is a cataloguing app designed to store recordsof items currently available on an online store. Users can assign the item an name, identification code, category and price.
The app allows users to add, update, list and delete any records stored in the catalogue. The app also allows users to archive items that are no longer available, meaning their record is still in the catalogue, but is no longer active.
The listing function allows users to specify if they wish to search for active items, archived items or both.

In addition to storing items, a second class is used which allows users to add a status to any item, such as available, currently unavailable or coming soon. Statuses can be added, updated and deleted withoud affecting the item they are applied to.
In addition, the app also allows users to search by status. If the user wishes, the app can list all items with a specific status attatched to them.

Should the catalogue prove too confusing, a simple help feature is included. This will give instructions on what each action does and how to use them.

The app was made in IntelliJ, using Kotlin and Gradle. The app has had KDok, Dokka and Jacoco applied and has been subjected to linting. The only use of AI was in the creation of KDoc comments. Aside from these, no AI was used throughout the process of this app.
